Hello, I am sharing with you the instagram bulk profile editing codes that I created for my own needs as a result of months.
Instagrapi infrastructure was used It will never work without Instagrapi.
Download the latest version of instagrapi and put maraba.py in the main folder and transfer the doc folder into the main folder in the same way.

https://github.com/subzeroid/instagrapi/tree/master

write username:pass:mail:mailpass in user_credentials.txt in doc folder
in maraba.py at line 640 cl = Client(proxy="TYPE PROXY HERE") don't forget to write proxy in this section
If the e-mail addresses to which your Instagram accounts are linked are imap-compliant, it will automatically enter the mail confirmation codes itself.

Use doc/setting.txt

Share_random_videos = share random videos from the videos in the doc/video folder You can choose how many videos you want to share with "num_videos"
Change_profile_photo = to randomly change the profile photo with the images in the doc/profilephoto folder (if there is 1 image, all accounts will have the same profile photo)
delete_all_post = Set to clear all shared posts
set_account_private = Make account private
set_account_public = Makes the account public  
Share_random_reels = allows to share random reels from videos in doc/reel folder "num_reels" how many reels to share
share_random_photos = allows to share as a random post from the photos in the doc/photo folder "num_photos" how many photos to share
delete_external_link = Deletes the website link, i.e. External_link, in the current Biography
change_external_url = Replaces the link with a new one after deleting it "external_link" write the new link here
Change_bio = Change biography Note: Make sure there are 2 text documents named bio.txt and bio1.txt in the doc folder and write the same biography in both of them, if you want to use random biography, create text documents like bio1-bio2-bio3 and write a different biography in each of them, it will select randomly.
Change_name= Change the name (type the names in name.txt and it will select them from there, type the same name multiple times in a row)
Change_username= Changes username Enter usernames in newusername.txt with a different username on each line and it will randomly select and change them from there
change_password= if you set this to true, it will update your password with the password you typed in "new_password".


Other settings not listed here but in setting.txt are experimental. They may not work, so I recommend using only the features I have described here





In the meantime, I sell 1600 instagram accounts suitable for the API system, all of the accounts I sell are private accounts, all of them were used without any problems in the infrastructure you see.
